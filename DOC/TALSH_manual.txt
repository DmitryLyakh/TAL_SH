0. Preamble

The TAL-SH library provides API for performing basic tensor algebra
operations on multicore CPU, NVidia GPU, Intel Xeon Phi, and other
accelerators (in future). Basic tensor algebra operations include
tensor contraction, tensor product, tensor addition, tensor transpose,
multiplication by a scalar, etc., which operate on locally stored tensors.
The execution of tensor operations on accelerators is asynchronous with
respect to the CPU Host, if the underlying node is heterogeneous. Both
Fortran and C/C++ API interfaces are provided. The library has a simplified
object-oriented design, although without explicit object-oriented syntax
(no explicit C++/Fortran classes). As a consequence, in C/C++ the basic
TAL-SH objects, like <talsh_tens_t>, <talsh_tens_shape_t>, <talsh_task_t>, etc.
must always be "cleaned" before the first use in case they are declared
statically (dynamically created objects are cleaned automatically). In Fortran,
the defaut type initializers will automatically clean new objects. The main
reason the library is not implemented in C++ is the necessity of Fortran/C
interoperability, to support both Fortran and C/C++ applications. However,
upon necessity, it should be relatively easy to wrap the TAL-SH API
with the C++ or Fortran-2003 object-oriented syntactic "sugar":
 (a) ObjectClean() becomes the trivial constructor in C++;
 (b) ObjectConstruct() becomes the non-trivial constructor in C++
     and Fortran-2003;
 (c) ObjectDestruct() becomes the destructor in C++ and the final
     subroutine in Fortran-2003;
 (d) ObjectCreate() and ObjectDestroy() are replaced by "new" and
     "delete" in C++.
 (e) No copy constructor and copy assignment are provided so far.


1. Nomenclature and general information

Tensor: A multi-dimensional array of real or complex numbers.
Both real and complex numbers come either in a single-precision
form (R4/C4) or double precision form (R8/C8).

Tensor Block (TB): A locally stored slice of a tensor.
In general, a tensor block is defined by its
(a) Data kind: Real (R4, R8) or complex (C4, C8);
(b) Signature: A unique identifier of this specific tensor block;
(c) Shape: Tensor block rank, dimension extents, storage layout;
(d) Body: Values of the tensor elements.

Data consistency: In the current implementation of TAL-SH,
a tensor block may have its body simultaneously residing in
memory on multiple devices, transparently to the user.
Consequently, the tensor body can be fetched from multiple
locations in general. In case the tensor body is modified in
one of the locations, all other locations are automatically
discarded by the TAL-SH runtime to guarantee data consistency.

Host Argument Buffer (HAB): An optional buffer can be created in
pinned Host memory that can later be used for storing tensor blocks.
Preallocation of this buffer is recommended in order to avoid bad
memory fragmentation issues and minimize the overhead associated
with Host memory pinning when running asynchronous operations
(the memory fragmentation can still occur, ranging from 0% (best)
to 50% (worst), with an average of 25% of memory wasting).
In contrast, memory allocations on all other device kinds,
like GPU, MIC, etc., are always performed via argument buffers
(custom memory allocators). These device argument buffers (DAB)
are created when the library is initialized at the beginning and
destroyed when the library is finalized. The memory fragmentation
characteristics is the same as for the CPU Host argument buffer.


2. TAL-SH control API

Supported device kinds:
 DEV_NULL: Abstract null device [-1];
 DEV_HOST: Multicore CPU Host: Device range [0];
 DEV_NVIDIA_GPU: NVidia GPU: Device range [0..MAX_GPUS_PER_NODE-1];
 DEV_INTEL_MIC: Intel Xeon Phi: Device range [0..MAX_MICS_PER_NODE-1];
 DEV_AMD_GPU: AMD GPU (future): Device range [0..MAX_AMDS_PER_NODE-1];

 Note that self-hosted platforms will fall under the DEV_HOST kind,
 regardless of the actual hardware.

Flat device numeration:
 Each device of each kind also has a flat device id in the range [0..DEV_MAX-1].
 0 is always reserved for the Host. Some functions, namely those which convert
 between the flat and device kind specific numerations, may also return DEV_MAX
 with the meaning of "out of range" (error code). Hereafter, the id of a device
 within its kind will be referred to as "kind-specific", as opposed to its flat id.

3. TAL-SH tensor block API

At the user level, a tensor block is represented by an interoperable type <talsh_tens_t>.
A tensor block either can be constructed from scrath, including memory allocation, or
an existing tensor block can be registered for the use in TAL-SH. In the former case,
the tensor block can either be allocated in regular memory or in the pinned Host/Device argument
buffer (HAB/DAB). Furthermore, an allocated tensor block can be initialized to some constant value
or a user-defined initialization method can be invoked on it. In all cases, TAL-SH does not
allocate/deallocate the <talsh_tens_t> object itself, which is the user responsibility. Instead
TAL-SH uses an existing empty <talsh_tens_t> object and just constructs it upon a user request.
In C/C++ code, one should use talshTensorCreate() to dynamically allocate a <talsh_tens_t> object
whereas statically allocated <talsh_tens_t> objects must be cleaned via talshTensorClean()
before the first non-trivial construction! Throughout its life, a tensor block may have
its body residing on multiple devices simultaneously, where the data kind may differ
from device to device (single/double precision for example). The consistency of the
data is maintained automatically by the TAL-SH runtime.

The initial status of statically allocated tensor block objects <talsh_tens_t> in C/C++
is undefined. It becomes defined-empty (clean) after talshTensorClean(). The initial
status of dynamically allocated tensor block objects <talsh_tens_t> in C/C++ and
statically/dynamically allocated tensor block objects <talsh_tens_t> in Fortran
is defined-empty (clean) from the point of creation. A clean tensor block object becomes
value-defined after a constructor has been called on it successfully. A tensor block
returns to the defined-empty (clean) state after destruction. Additionally, dynamically
allocated tensor blocks can be destroyed completely. In Fortran, an explcit call to
the destructor is mandatory before destroying the tensor block via deallocate().
In C/C++, talshTensorDestroy() function automatically calls the destructor.
Some (critical) errors may change the status of the tensor block to undefined.
Return statuses "TRY_LATER", "DEVICE_UNABLE", and "NOT_CLEAN" are generally not
considered critical, although "NOT_CLEAN" may indicate a memory leak (not always).
The former two return statuses mean that the chosen device is either temporarily ("TRY_LATER")
or permanently ("DEVICE_UNABLE") unable to perform the requested function/operation.

When passing <talsh_tens_t> as an argument to a Fortran procedure, the intent(inout)
specifier must be used. Never use intent(out) with <talsh_tens_t> as it will destroy
the internal state of the <talsh_tens_t> object, leaving it undefined.

For developers only:
 Depending on the device, a tensor block is further specialized to one of the two internal types:
 <tensor_block_t> (for the use on CPU and MIC) and <tensBlck_t> (for the use on NVidia GPU).
 Type <tensor_block_t> is natively defined in Fortran and is emulated in C (opaque handle).
 Type <tensBlck_t> is natively defined in C and is emulated in Fortran (opaque handle).

API: Create an empty tensor block object:

 C/C++:
  int talshTensorCreate(      //out: error code (0: success, TRY_LATER: currently no enough memory available)
   talsh_tens_t ** tens_block //out: a pointer to an empty tensor block
  )

  NOTE: Upon success, the tensor block becomes defined (but empty).

API: Clean a tensor block (set it to defined-empty):

 C/C++:
  int talshTensorClean(      //out: error code (0: success, TRY_LATER: currently no enough memory available)
   talsh_tens_t * tens_block //inout: tensor block set to empty
  )

  NOTE: This function should only be called on undefined statically allocated
        C/C++ <talsh_tens_t> objects to make them defined-empty (clean).
        Passing value-defined <talsh_tens_t> objects here will lead to
        an undefined behavior.

API: Check whether a tensor block is empty:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_is_empty(tens_block) result(res)
   logical:: res                               !out: .TRUE. if the tensor block is empty, .FALSE. otherwise
   type(talsh_tens_t), intent(in):: tens_block !in: tensor block

 C/C++:
  int talshTensorIsEmpty(    //out: YEP if the tensor block is empty, NOPE if not, error code otherwise
   talsh_tens_t * tens_block //in: tensor block
  )

  NOTE: In C/C++, this function should only be called on defined tensor blocks (either clean or value defined).

API: Construct a tensor block:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_construct(tens_block,data_kind,tens_shape,dev_id,ext_mem,in_hab,init_method,init_val) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr !out: error code (0: success, TRY_LATER: currently no enough memory available)
   type(talsh_tens_t), intent(inout):: tens_block                      !inout: constructed tensor block (must be empty on entrance)
   integer(C_INT), intent(in):: data_kind                              !in: data kind: {R4,R8,C4,C8,NO_TYPE}
   {integer(C_INT),dimension(:)|character(*)|type(tensor_shape_t)}, intent(in):: tens_shape !in: tensor shape (either digital or symbolic)
   integer(C_INT), intent(in), optional:: dev_id                       !in: flat device ID on which the tensor block will reside
   type(C_PTR), intent(in), optional:: ext_mem                         !in: pointer to externally provided memory for tensor elements
   integer(C_INT), intent(in), optional:: in_hab                       !in: if >=0, a non-NULL <ext_mem> points to the HAB/DAB entry #<in_hab>
   procedure(talsh_tens_init_i), optional:: init_method                !in: user-defined initialization method
   complex(8), intent(in), optional:: init_val                         !in: initialization value (will be typecast to <data_kind>, defaults to 0)

 C/C++:
  int talshTensorConstruct(              //out: error code (0: success, TRY_LATER: currently no enough memory available)
   talsh_tens_t * tens_block,            //inout: constructed tensor block (must be empty on entrance)
   int data_kind,                        //in: data kind: {R4,R8,C4,C8,NO_TYPE}
   int tens_rank,                        //in: tensor block rank
   const int tens_dims[],                //in: tensor block dimension extents
   int dev_id = 0,                       //in: flat device ID on which the tensor block will reside
   void * ext_mem = NULL,                //in: pointer to externally provided memory for tensor elements
   int in_hab = -1,                      //in: if >=0, a non-NULL <ext_mem> points to the HAB/DAB entry #<in_hab>
   talsh_tens_init_i init_method = NULL, //in: user-defined initialization method (function pointer)
   double init_val_real = 0.0,           //in: initialization value (real part), defaults to 0
   double init_val_imag = 0.0            //in: initialization value (imaginary part), defaults to 0
  )

  Description:
   A tensor block shape can be specified via an integer array whose length
   will define the tensor rank and each element will define the extent of the
   corresponding dimension of the tensor block (in C/C++ one will need to
   provide the tensor block rank explicitly). Another option is to pass the
   tensor shape object directly (only Fortran). Alternatively, the shape of a
   tensor block can be specified symbolically as a string of characters:
   '(E1,E2,...,En)',
   where
    n is the tensor block rank (the number of dimensions),
    Ex is the extent of dimension x.
   By default, the seniority of tensor dimensions increases to the right (Fortran-like).
   If neither <ext_mem> nor <in_hab> are explicitly passed, the tensor body will be
   allocated in regular memory on device <dev_id>; if <ext_mem> is present but <in_hab>
   is not, the tensor body will reside in the location pointed to by <ext_mem> on device <dev_id>
   (it is the user responsibility to make sure <ext_mem> refers to memory on device <dev_id>);
   if both <ext_mem> and <in_hab> are present, the tensor body will reside in the location
   pointed to by <ext_mem>, which is assumed to be in the HAB/DAB buffer as entry #<in_hab> on
   device <dev_id> (it is the user responsibility to ensure consistency of the arguments);
   if <ext_mem> is absent (NULL) but <in_hab> is present and >=0, the tensor body will be
   allocated in the HAB/DAB buffer on device <dev_id> (if that device has a HAB/DAB buffer).
   However, if <data_kind>=NO_TYPE and <ext_mem>=NULL (absent) no memory will be provided
   for the tensor body (deferred for later), whereas in case <ext_mem> is not NULL (present)
   the externally provided memory space will serve as storage for the tensor body,
   even if <data_kind>=NO_TYPE (in this case, the tensor body can be initialized later,
   upon deciding on the data kind). The initialization of the tensor body will be
   performed in case <ext_mem>=NULL and <data_kind>!=NO_TYPE, but not otherwise.
   A user-defined initialization method must have the following interface:

   Fortran 2003:
    abstract interface
     integer(C_INT) function talsh_tens_init_i(tens_body_p,data_kind,tens_shape,tens_signature) bind(c) !out: returns an error code
      type(C_PTR), value:: tens_body_p                     !in: pointer to the tensor elements storage (tensor body)
      integer(C_INT), value:: data_kind                    !in: data kind: {R4,R8,C4,C8}
      type(talsh_tens_shape_t), intent(in):: tens_shape    !in: tensor shape
      integer(C_LONG_LONG), intent(in):: tens_signature(*) !in: tensor signature
     end function talsh_tens_init_i
    end interface

   C/C++:
    typedef int (*talsh_tens_init_i)(void * tens_body_p, const int data_kind, const talsh_tens_shape_t * tens_shape, const long long * tens_signature);

   The user-defined initialization method takes precedence over the initialization value.
   The intialization value, if provided, will only be used if the initialization method
   is absent (Fortran) or NULL (C/C++). If neither initialization method nor initialization
   value is provided, the tensor block will still be initialized to zero.

   The interface of the user-defined initialization method may often be found
   to be too restricive since no additional information can be provided. In this case,
   an alternative solution is to simply construct a tensor block without any initialization
   method and then use the function <talshTensorGetBodyAccess()> to obtain a C pointer
   to the tensor image of proper data kind on a desired device. This C pointer can be
   used for defining the value of that tensor image (all other images, if any, will
   automatically be discarded by the TAL-SH runtime). This alternative method can be
   used anytime, not necessarily right after the tensor construction. However, the
   tensor is not expected to participate in any tensor operation at that point.

   NOTE: This function must only be called on clean tensor blocks (empty defined).

   NOTE:`So far the initialization only works for the CPU Host (DEV_HOST).
         On other device kinds, the tensor block is left undefined and
         a separate initialization operation will be required to define it.

API: Destruct a tensor block (release all resources and set it to empty):

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_destruct(tens_block) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                          !out: error code (0:success)
   type(talsh_tens_t), intent(inout):: tens_block !inout: destructed tensor block (but not <tens_block> itself)

 C/C++:
  int talshTensorDestruct(   //out: error code (0:success)
   talsh_tens_t * tens_block //inout: destructed tensor block (but not <tens_block> itself)
  )

  NOTE: In C/C++, this function must not be called on static undefined (not cleaned) tensor blocks.

API: Destroy a tensor block object (destruct it first and then completely destroy the object):

 C/C++:
  int talshTensorDestroy(    //out: error code (0:success)
   talsh_tens_t * tens_block //inout: a tensor block (will be destroyed on exit)
  )

  NOTE: In C/C++, this function must not be called on static undefined (not cleaned) tensor blocks.

API: Get the rank of a tensor block (number of dimensions):

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_rank(tens_block) result(rank)
   integer(C_INT):: rank                       !out: tensor block rank
   type(talsh_tens_t), intent(in):: tens_block !in: tensor block

 C/C++:
  int talshTensorRank(             //out: tensor block rank
   const talsh_tens_t * tens_block //in: pointer to a tensor block
  )

  NOTE: In C/C++, this function must not be called on static undefined (not cleaned) tensor blocks.

API: Get the volume of a tensor block (number of elements):

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_volume(tens_block) result(vol)

   int dev_kind = DEV_NULL      //in: requested device kind (if present, <dev_id> is kind-specific)
  )

  Description:
   This function returns a pointer to the tensor image which has the requested <data_kind>
   and resides on device <dev_id> (or {<dev_kind>,<dev_id>}). If no match, returns TALSH_NOT_FOUND.

  NOTE: Upon success, all other tensor images will be discarded. The tensor block must not be in use
        in order for this function to succeed. If it is in use, TALSH_NOT_ALLOWED will be returned.

4. TAL-SH task API

An interoperable TAL-SH task handle <talsh_task_t> is returned by every asynchronous
tensor operation. It is associated with that specific operation and can later be used
for checking the completion of the operation and obtaining other information, like
timing, flop count, data size, etc. The lifecycle of a <talsh_task_t> object is
similar to that of <talsh_tens_t>, with possible statuses:
 (a) Undefined: Statically allocated C/C++ <talsh_task_t> objects (C-like);
 (b) Defined-empty (clean): Dynamically allocated C/C++ <talsh_task_t> objects
                            and all Fortran <talsh_task_t> objects at creation,
                            also all properly destructed <talsh_task_t> objects;
 (c) Value-defined: All <talsh_task_t> objects successfully constructed;
A peculiarity of <talsh_task_t> is that it should never be constructed explicitly
by the user because the construction is done implictly when a tensor operation
returns the <talsh_task_t> handle back to the user. However, the user may call
a destructor on a retired <talsh_task_t> object to reuse it in new operations.
It is errorneous to call talshTaskClean() on value-defined <talsh_task_t> objects
and to call any other talshTaskXXX() function on undefined <talsh_task_t> objects.
In Fortran, a value-defined dynamically allocated <talsh_task_t> object must be
destructed before calling deallocate() on it (to release the memory completely).

API: Create a clean TAL-SH task (dynamic allocation):

 C/C++:
  int talshTaskCreate(        //out: error code (0:success)
   talsh_task_t ** talsh_task //out: defined-empty (clean) TAL-SH task
  )

API: Clean a TAL-SH task:

 C/C++:
  int talshTaskClean(        //out: error code (0:success)
   talsh_task_t * talsh_task //inout: undefined TAL-SH task (clean on exit)
  )

  NOTE: This function should only be called on undefined statically allocated
        C/C++ <talsh_task_t> objects to make them defined-empty (clean).
        Passing value-defined <talsh_task_t> objects here will lead to
        an undefined behavior.

API: Destruct a TAL-SH task:

 Fortran 2003:
  talsh_task_destruct(talsh_task) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                          //out: error code (0:success)
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout):: talsh_task //inout: defined TAL-SH task (clean on exit)

 C/C++:
  int talshTaskDestruct(     //out: error code (0:success)
   talsh_task_t * talsh_task //inout: defined TAL-SH task (clean on exit)
  )

  NOTE: This function should not be called on undefined <talsh_task_t> objects.

API: Destroy a TAL-SH task:

 C/C++:
  int talshTaskDestroy(      //out: error code (0:success)
   talsh_task_t * talsh_task //inout: defined TAL-SH task
  )

API: Get the id of the device the TAL-SH task is scheduled on:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_task_dev_id(talsh_task,dev_kind) result(dev_id)
   integer(C_INT):: dev_id                          !out: device id (either kind-specific or flat), -1 if error
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout):: talsh_task   !in: TAL-SH task handle
   integer(C_INT), intent(out), optional:: dev_kind !out: device kind (if present, <dev_id> will return the kind-specific device id)

 C/C++:
  int talshTaskDevId(         //out: device id (either kind-specific or flat), -1 if error
   talsh_task_t * talsh_task, //in: TAL-SH task handle
   int * dev_kind = NULL      //out: device kind (if present, <dev_id> will return the kind-specific device id)
  )

API: Get the TAL-SH task status:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_task_status(talsh_task) result(stat)
   integer(C_INT):: stat                          !out: task status (see below), TALSH_FAILURE if failed
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout):: talsh_task !inout: TAL-SH task handle

 C/C++:
  int talshTaskStatus(       //out: task status (see below), TALSH_FAILURE if failed
   talsh_task_t * talsh_task //inout: TAL-SH task handle
  )

  Description:
   Possible task status:
    TALSH_TASK_ERROR: An error occured during task scheduling or execution
    TALSH_TASK_EMPTY: The task has not been scheduled yet (clean)
    TALSH_TASK_SCHEDULED: The task has been successfully scheduled
    TALSH_TASK_STARTED: The task started execution
    TALSH_TASK_INPUT_READY: The input data is on device
    TALSH_TASK_OUTPUT_READY: The output data is on device
    TALSH_TASK_COMPLETED: The task is completed

  NOTE: If the task scheduling call (tensor operation) returns TRY_LATER or DEVICE_UNABLE,
        which are not errors, the task status is kept TALSH_TASK_EMPTY (clean).

API: Check whether a TAL-SH task has completed:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_task_complete(talsh_task,stats,ierr) result(done)
   integer(C_INT):: done                          !out: YEP if the task has completed, NOPE otherwise
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout):: talsh_task !inout: TAL-SH task handle
   integer(C_INT), intent(out):: stats            !out: TAL-SH task status
   integer(C_INT), intent(out):: ierr             !out: error code (0:success)

 C/C++:
  int talshTaskComplete(      //out: YEP if the task has completed, NOPE otherwise
   talsh_task_t * talsh_task, //inout: TAL-SH task handle
   int * stats,               //out: TAL-SH task status
   int * ierr                 //out: error code (0:success)
  )

  NOTE: Task completion assumes either TALSH_TASK_COMPLETED status
        or TALSH_TASK_ERROR status.

API: Wait upon completion of a TAL-SH task:

 Fortran 2003:
  talsh_task_wait(talsh_task,stats) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                          !out: error code (0:success)
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout):: talsh_task !inout: TAL-SH task handle
   integer(C_INT), intent(out):: stats            !out: TAL-SH task status

 C/C++:
  int talshTaskWait(          //out: error code (0:success)
   talsh_task_t * talsh_task, //inout: TAL-SH task handle
   int * stats                //out: TAL-SH task status
  )

  NOTE: Task completion assumes either TALSH_TASK_COMPLETED status
        or TALSH_TASK_ERROR status.

API: Wait upon completion of multiple TAL-SH tasks:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tasks_wait(ntasks,talsh_tasks,stats) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                                     !out: error code (0:success)
   integer(C_INT), intent(in):: ntasks                       !in: number of tasks
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout):: talsh_tasks(1:ntasks) !inout: TAL-SH tasks handles
   integer(C_INT), intent(out):: stats(1:ntasks)             !out: TAL-SH task statuses

 C/C++:
  int talshTasksWait(          //out: error code (0:success)
   int ntasks,                 //in: number of tasks
   talsh_task_t talsh_tasks[], //inout: TAL-SH task handles (pointers)
   int stats[]                 //out: TAL-SH task statuses
  )

  NOTE: Task completion assumes either TALSH_TASK_COMPLETED status
        or TALSH_TASK_ERROR status.

API: Get the TAL-SH task timings:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_task_time(talsh_task,total,comput,input,output) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                          !out: error code (0:success)
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout):: talsh_task !inout: TAL-SH task handle
   real(8), intent(out):: total                   !out: total execution time (sec)
   real(8), intent(out), optional:: comput        !out: time the computation took (sec)
   real(8), intent(out), optional:: input         !out: time the ingoing data transfers took (sec)
   real(8), intent(out), optional:: output        !out: time the outgoing data transfers took (sec)

 C/C++:
  int talshTaskTime(          //out: error code (0:success)
   talsh_task_t * talsh_task, //inout: TAL-SH task handle
   double * total,            //out: total execution time (sec)
   double * comput = NULL,    //out: time the computation took (sec)
   double * input = NULL,     //out: time the ingoing data transfers took (sec)
   double * output = NULL     //out: time the outgoing data transfers took (sec)
  )

  NOTE: Since an asynchronous execution of multiple tasks on the same device utilizes
        the same hardware resources, the corresponding timings will be non-exclusive.


5. TAL-SH tensor operations API

Each tensor operation can be executed asynchronously with respect to the Host,
unless a synchronization is requested. An asynchronous execution is activated
automatically when a TAL-SH task handle passed to the corresponding call. Also,
each tensor operation accepts an argument, called "copy control", that regulates
whether the data will be kept on device or discarded after the task completion.
It also specifies whether the data should be discarded from the source device after
it has been copied to the device which will execute the task (if those are distinct).
In case when a tensor block resides on one device but participates in a tensor
operation scheduled on a different device, the former will be called the "source device"
while the latter will be called the "destination device" (the two can be the same in general).
The "copy control" parameter name has the following structure:
 COPY_X: For tensor operations with a single tensor argument;
 COPY_XX: For tensor operations with two tensor arguments (lhs,rhs);
 COPY_XXX: For tensor operations with three tensor arguments (lhs,rhs1,rhs2).
where each "X" refers to the corresponding tensor argument (tensor block),
with the following options:
 X=D: Discard the tensor argument from both the source and destination devices after the task completion;
 X=M: Discard the tensor argument from the source device after the task completion if the source
      device differs from the destination device, otherwise do nothing;
 X=T: Discard the tensor argument from the destination device if the destination device
      differs from the source device, otherwise do nothing;
 X=K: Keep the tensor argument on both devices if they are different.

To remember the meaning of the above control letters, "D" stands for "discard",
"M" stands for "move", "T" stands for "temporary", "K" stands for "keep".

If a task cannot be scheduled at this point due to the lack of resources (memory, etc.),
a return status TRY_LATER will indicate that. If a task cannot be scheduled
in principle on a particular device, a return status DEVICE_UNABLE will
indicate that. Note that both TRY_LATER and DEVICE_UNABLE are not errors.
A successful scheduling will be indicated by a return status TALSH_SUCCESS (0).
A successful scheduling does not guarantee a successful execution, in general.

API: Place a tensor block on a specific device:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_place(tens,dev_id,dev_kind,copy_ctrl,talsh_task) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                              !out: error code (0:success)

   int dev_kind = DEV_DEFAULT //in: device kind (if present, <dev_id> is kind-specific)
  )
