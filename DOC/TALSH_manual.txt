NOTE: This is how the TAL-SH API interface will look like soon!
      Currently the source code still consists of separate pieces,
      each one specific for a particular device kind.


0. Preambule

The TAL-SH library provides API for performing basic tensor algebra
operations on multicore CPU, NVidia GPU, Intel Xeon Phi, and other
accelerators (in future). Basic tensor algebra operations include
tensor contraction, tensor product, tensor addition, tensor transpose,
multiplication by a scalar, etc., which operate on locally stored tensors.
The execution of tensor operations on accelerators is asynchronous with
respect to the CPU Host, if the underlying node is heterogeneous. Both
Fortran and C API interfaces are provided (Fortran 2003 and later).


1. Nomenclature

Tensor: A multi-dimensional array of real or complex numbers. Real
numbers can be in either single (R4) or double precision (R8).
Complex numbers always assume double precision (C8).

Tensor Block (TB): A locally stored slice of a tensor.
In general, a tensor block is defined by its
(a) Data type: Real (R4, R8) or complex (C8);
(b) Signature: A unique identifier of this specific tensor block;
(c) Shape: Tensor block rank, dimension extents, storage layout;
(d) Tensor elements: Values of the elements of the tensor block.

Host Argument Buffer (HAB): An optional buffer can be created in
pinned Host memory that can be later used for storing tensor blocks.
Preallocation of this buffer is recommended in order to avoid
memory fragmentation issues and minimize the overhead associated
with Host memory pinning.


2. Device control API

Supported device kinds:
 DEV_NULL: Abstract null device [-1];
 DEV_HOST: Multicore CPU: Device range [0];
 DEV_NVIDIA_GPU: NVidia GPU: Device range [0..MAX_GPUS_PER_NODE-1];
 DEV_INTEL_MIC: Intel Xeon Phi: Device range [0..MAX_MICS_PER_NODE-1];
 DEV_AMD_GPU: AMD APU (future): Device range [0..MAX_AMDS_PER_NODE-1];

 Note that self-hosted platforms will fall under the DEV_HOST kind,
 regardless of the actual hardware.

Flat device numeration:
 Each device of each kind also has a flat device id in the range [0..DEV_MAX-1].
 0 is always reserved for the Host. Some functions, which convert
 between the flat and device kind specific numerations, may also return DEV_MAX
 with the meaning of "out of range" (error code). Hereafter, the id of a device
 within its kind will be referred to as "kind-specific", as opposed to its flat id.

API: Initialize the TAL-SH library:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_init(host_buf_size,host_arg_max,gpu_list,mic_list,apu_list) result(ierr):
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                                      !out: error code (0:success)
   integer(C_SIZE_T), intent(inout), optional:: host_buf_size !inout: desired size in bytes of the Host Argument Buffer.
                                                              !       It will be replaced by the actual size.

3. Tensor block API

At the user level, a tensor block is represented by an interoperable type <talsh_tens_t>.
A tensor block either can be constructed from scrath, including memory allocation, or
an existing tensor block can be registered for the use in TAL-SH. Furthermore, an allocated
tensor block can be initialized to some constant value or a user-defined initialization method
can be invoked on it. In all cases, TAL-SH does not allocate/deallocate the <talsh_tens_t> object
itself, which is a user responsibility! Instead TAL-SH uses an exsiting <talsh_tens_t> handle.

For developers only:
 Depending on the device, a tensor block is specified via one of the two internal types:
 <tensor_block_t> (for the use on CPU and MIC) and <tensBlck_t> (for the use on NVidia GPU).
 Type <tensor_block_t> is natively defined in Fortran 2003 and is emulated in C (opaque handle).
 Type <tensBlck_t> is natively defined in C and is emulated in Fortran (opaque handle).

API: Construct a tensor block:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_construct(tens_block,data_type,tens_shape,ext_ptr,use_hab,dev_target,init_val,init_method) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr !out: error code (0: success, TRY_LATER: currently no enough memory available)
   type(talsh_tens_t), intent(inout):: tens_block                      !out: constructed tensor block
   integer(C_INT), intent(in):: data_type                              !in: data type: {R4,R8,C8}
   {integer(C_INT),dimension(:)|character(*)|type(tensor_shape_t)}, intent(in):: tens_shape !in: tensor shape (either digital or symbolic)
   type(C_PTR), intent(in), optional:: ext_ptr                         !in: pointer to an externally provided memory for tensor elements
   logical, intent(in), optional:: use_hab                             !in: if TRUE, memory allocation will be done via HAB (defaults to FALSE)
   complex(8), intent(in), optional:: init_val                         !in: initialization value (will be typecast to <data_type>, defaults to 0)
   procedure(talsh_tens_init_i), optional:: init_method                !in: user-defined initialization method

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Tensor_Construct(  //out: error code (0: success, TRY_LATER: currently no enough memory available)
   talsh_tens_t * tens_block,  //out: constructed tensor block
   int data_type,              //in: data type: {R4,R8,C8}
   int tens_rank,              //in: tensor block rank
   int tens_dims[],            //in: tensor block dimension extents
   void * ext_ptr = NULL,      //in: pointer to an externally provided memory for tensor elements
   int use_hab = 0,            //in: if TRUE, memory allocation will be done via HAB (defaults to FALSE)
   double init_val_real = 0.0  //in: initialization value (real part), defaults to 0
   double init_val_imag = 0.0  //in: initialization value (imaginary part), defaults to 0
   talsh_tens_init_i = NULL    //in: user-defined initialization method (function pointer)
  )

 Description:
  A tensor block shape can be specified via an integer array whose length
  will define the tensor rank and each element will define the extent of the
  corresponding dimension of the tensor block. Alternatively, the shape of a
  tensor block can be specified symbolically as a string of characters:
  '(E1,E2,...,En)',
  where
   n is the tensor block rank (the number of dimensions),
   Ex is the extent of dimension x.
  By default, the seniority of tensor dimensions increases to the right (Fortran-like).
  An optional user-defined initialization method must have the following interface:
  Fortran 2003:
   abstract interface
    subroutine talsh_tens_init_i(tens_ptr,data_type,tens_rank,tens_dims,ierr)
     type(C_PTR), value:: tens_ptr                !in: pointer to the tensor elements storage
     integer(C_INT), value:: data_type            !in: data type: {R4,R8,C8}
     integer(C_INT), value:: tens_rank            !in: tensor block rank
     integer(C_INT), intent(in):: tens_dims(1:*)  !in: tensor block dimension extents
     integer(C_INT), intent(out):: ierr           !out: error code (0:success)
    end subroutine talsh_tens_init_i
   end interface
  C/C++:
   typedef void (*talsh_tens_init_i)(void * tens_ptr, int data_type, int tens_rank, int tens_dims[], int * ierr);

API: Destroy a tensor block:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_destroy(tens_block) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                          !out: error code (0:success)
   type(talsh_tens_t), intent(inout):: tens_block !inout: destroyed tensor block (but not <tens_block> itself)

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Tensor_Destroy(  //out: error code (0:success)
   talsh_tens_t * tens_block //inout: destroyed tensor block (but not <tens_block> itself)
  )

API: Get the volume of a tensor block (number of elements):

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_volume(tens_block) result(vol)
   integer(INTL):: vol                         !out: number of elements in the tensor block (negative on error)
   type(talsh_tens_t), intent(in):: tens_block !in: tensor block

 C/C++:
  long long int talsh_Tensor_Volume( //out: number of elements in the tensor block (negative on error)
   const talsh_tens_t * tens_block   //in: pointer to a tensor block
  )

 Note: Return value 0 means that the tensor block is empty (null).

API: Get the data type of the tensor block:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_datatype(tens_block) result(datatyp)
   integer(C_INT):: datatyp                    !out: tensor data type (Success:{R4,R8,C8}; Error:NO_TYPE}
   type(talsh_tens_t), intent(in):: tens_block !in: tensor block

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Tensor_Datatype(       //out: tensor data type (Success:{R4,R8,C8}; Error:NO_TYPE)
   const talsh_tens_t * tens_block //in: pointer to a tensor block
  )

API: Get the shape of a tensor block:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_shape(tens_block,tens_shape) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                            !out: error code (0:success)
   type(talsh_tens_t), intent(in):: tens_block      !in: tensor block
   type(tensor_shape_t), intent(inout):: tens_shape !out: tensor block shape

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Tensor_Shape(           //out: error code (0:success)
   const talsh_tens_t * tens_block, //in: pointer to a tensor block
   talsh_tens_shape_t * tens_shape  //out: pointer to the shape of the tensor block (copy)
  )

API: Query the presence of a tensor block on device(s):

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tensor_presence(tens_block,ncopies,copies,dev_kind,dev_id) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                           !out: error code (0:success)
   type(talsh_tens_t), intent(in):: tens_block     !in: tensor block
   integer(C_INT), intent(out):: ncopies           !out: number of copies of the tensor block found
   integer(C_INT), intent(inout):: copies(1:*)     !out: copies found (list of device id's)
   integer(C_INT), intent(in), optional:: dev_kind !in: specific device kind of interest (defaults to All)
   integer(C_INT), intent(in), optional:: dev_id   !in: specific device of interest

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Tensor_Presence(        //out: error code (0:success)
   const talsh_tens_t * tens_block, //in: pointer to a tensor block
   int * ncopies,                   //out: number of copies of the tensor block found
   int copies[],                    //out: copies found (list of device id's)
   int dev_kind = DEV_NULL,         //in: specific device kind of interest (defaults to All)
   int dev_id = -1                  //in: specific device of interest
  )

 Note:
  This function returns a list of device id's which contain the given tensor block in memory.
  If <dev_kind> is present, <dev_id> (if present) carries the kind specific device id.
  If <dev_kind> is absent, <dev_id> (if present) carries the flat device id.


4. TAL-SH task API

A TAL-SH task handle is returned by every asynchronous tensor operation.
It is associated with that specific operation and can be used for checking
the completion of the operation and obtaining the timing information.

API: Clean a TAL-SH task for reuse:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_task_clean(task) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                    !out: error code (0:success)
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout):: task !inout: TAL-SH task handle

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Task_Clean( //out: error code (0:success)
   talsh_task_t * task  //inout: TAL-SH task handle
  )

 Note: A TAL-SH task handle needs to be cleaned before it can be used in another tensor operation.
       Also, the TAL-SH task handle must be cleaned before its first use.

API: Get the id of the device which the task is scheduled on:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_task_dev_id(task,dev_kind) result(dev_id)
   integer(C_INT):: dev_id                          !out: device id (either kind-specific or flat), -1 if error
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(in):: task            !in: TAL-SH task handle
   integer(C_INT), intent(out), optional:: dev_kind !out: device kind (if present, <dev_id> will return the kind-specific device id)

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Task_Dev_id(       //out: device id (either kind-specific or flat), -1 if error
   const talsh_task_t * task,  //in: TAL-SH task handle
   int * dev_kind = NULL //out: device kind (if present, <dev_id> will return the kind-specific device id)
  )

API: Get the TAL-SH task status:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_task_status(task) result(stat)
   integer(C_INT):: stat             !out: task status (see below), TALSH_FAILURE if failed
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout) !inout: TAL-SH task handle

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Task_Status( //out: task status (see below), TALSH_FAILURE if failed
   talsh_task_t * stat   //inout: TAL-SH task handle
  )

 Description:
  Possible task status:
   TALSH_TASK_ERROR: An error occured during task scheduling or execution
   TALSH_TASK_EMPTY: The task has not been scheduled yet
   TALSH_TASK_SCHEDULED: The task has been successfully scheduled
   TALSH_TASK_STARTED: The task started execution
   TALSH_TASK_INPUT_READY: The input data is on device
   TALSH_TASK_OUTPUT_READY: The output data is on device
   TALSH_TASK_COMPLETED: The task is completed

  Note:
   If the task scheduling call (tensor operation) returns TRY_LATER or DEVICE_UNSUITABLE,
   which are not errors, the task status is kept TALSH_TASK_EMPTY.

API: Check whether a TAL-SH task has completed:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_task_completed(task,ierr) result(done)
   logical:: done                           !out: TRUE if the task has completed, FALSE otherwise
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout):: task !inout: TAL-SH task handle
   integer(C_INT), intent(out):: ierr       !out: error code (0:success)

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Task_Completed( //out: 1 if the task has completed, 0 otherwise
   talsh_task_t * task,     //inout: TAL-SH task handle
   int * ierr               //out: error code (0:success)
  )

API: Wait upon a completion of a TAL-SH task:

 Fortran 2003:
  talsh_task_wait(task) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                    !out: error code (0:success)
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout):: task !inout: TAL-SH task handle

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Task_Wait( //out: error code (0:success)
   talsh_task_t * task //inout: TAL-SH task handle
  )

API: Wait upon a completion of multiple TAL-SH tasks:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_tasks_wait(ntasks,tasks) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                               !out: error code (0:success)
   integer(C_INT), intent(in):: ntasks                 !in: number of tasks
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(inout):: tasks(1:ntasks) !inout: TAL-SH tasks handles

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Tasks_Wait(  //out: error code (0:success)
   int ntasks,           //in: number of tasks
   talsh_task_t *tasks[] //inout: TAL-SH tasks handles
  )

API: Get the task timings:

 Fortran 2003:
  function talsh_task_time(task,total,comput,input,output) result(ierr)
   integer(C_INT):: ierr                   !out: error code (0:success)
   type(talsh_task_t), intent(in):: task   !in: TAL-SH task handle
   real(8), intent(out):: total            !out: total execution time (sec)
   real(8), intent(out), optional:: comput !out: time the computation took (sec)
   real(8), intent(out), optional:: input  !out: time the ingoing data transfers took (sec)
   real(8), intent(out), optional:: output !out: time the outgoing data transfers took (sec)

 C/C++:
  int talsh_Task_Time(        //out: error code (0:success)
   const talsh_task_t * task, //in: TAL-SH task handle
   double * total,            //out: total execution time (sec)
   double * comput = NULL,    //out: time the computation took (sec)
   double * input = NULL,     //out: time the ingoing data transfers took (sec)
   double * output = NULL     //out: time the outgoing data transfers took (sec)
  )

 Note:
  Since the asynchronous execution of multiple tasks on the same device utilizes
  the same hardware resources, the corresponding timings will be non-exclusive.


5. Tensor operations

Each tensor operation can be executed asynchronously with respect to the Host,
unless a synchronization is requested. An asynchronous execution is activated
automatically when a TAL-SH task handle passed to the corresponding call. Also,
each tensor operation accepts an argument, called "copy control", that regulates
whether the data will be kept on device or discarded after the task completion.
It also specifies whether the data should be discarded from the source device after
it has been copied to the device which will execute the task (if those are distinct).
In the case when a tensor block resides on one device but participates in a tensor
operation scheduled on a different device, the former will be called the "source device"
while the latter will be called the "destination device" (the two can be the same in general).
The "copy control" parameter name has the following structure:
 COPY_X: For tensor operations with a single tensor argument;
 COPY_XX: For tensor operations with two tensor arguments;
 COPY_XXX: For tensor operations with three tensor arguments.
where each "X" refers to the corresponding tensor argument (tensor block),
with the following options:
 X=D: Discard the tensor argument from both the source and destination devices after the task completion;
 X=M: Discard the tensor argument from the source device after the task completion if the source
      device differs from the destination device, otherwise do nothing;
 X=T: Discard the tensor argument from the destination device if the destination device
      differs from the source device, otherwise do nothing;
 X=K: Keep the tensor argument on both devices if they are different.

If a task cannot be scheduled at this point due to the lack of resources (memory, etc.),
a return status TRY_LATER will indicate that. If a task cannot be scheduled
in principle on a particular device, a return status DEVICE_UNSUITABLE will
indicate that. Note that both TRY_LATER and DEVICE_UNSUITABLE are not errors.
A successful scheduling will be indicated by a return status TALSH_SUCCESS (0).
A successful scheduling does not guarantee a successful execution, in general.
